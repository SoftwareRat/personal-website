# Hey, I'm SoftwareRat ðŸ‘‹

I'm a security researcher and FOSS developer who loves tinkering with systems and finding creative ways to make things work (or break). Most of my work revolves around cloud gaming security, console modding, and developing tools that make life easier for power users.

## What I Do

I spend most of my time:
- Breaking cloud gaming platforms (ethically, of course)
- Creating tools like USE (Unauthorized Software Enabler) in various languages
- Contributing to FOSS projects
- Writing about security research and tech

## My Setup

I work across different systems:
- **Main:** MacBook Air M1 running macOS (my daily driver)
- **School:** Surface Go 2 running Aurora Linux (because Windows was too slow)
- **Gaming:** Custom PC running Windows 10 LTSC 2021 (bloatware-free gaming)

## Recent Projects

Check out my [projects](/projects) page for my latest work, including:
- pkgrip: A fast Linux alternative for decrypting PS3/PSP pkgs
- USE: My collection of cloud gaming tools (in Python, Batch, C#, and PowerShell)
- Various automation scripts for cloud platforms
