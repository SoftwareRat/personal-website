# About Me

Hey! I'm a security researcher and developer with a passion for breaking things (ethically) and making cool tools. I got my start in the tech world through console modding and cloud gaming research, which led me down the rabbit hole of security research and tool development.

## My Work

I'm probably best known for my work on cloud gaming security, particularly:
- Finding ways to run unauthorized software on cloud gaming platforms
- Developing the USE (Unauthorized Software Enabler) toolkit in multiple languages
- Creating tools for console modding and game preservation

## My Setup

I work across three main systems:

### Daily Driver
- MacBook Air M1
- macOS Latest
- Perfect balance of power and portability for development

### School Machine
- Surface Go 2
- Aurora Linux
- Switched from Windows because it was too slow, now it flies

### Gaming Rig
- Custom Built PC
- Windows 10 LTSC 2021
- Stripped of bloatware for pure gaming performance

## Tools & Languages

I work with whatever gets the job done, but I'm particularly experienced with:
- Python for quick tool development
- Batch/PowerShell for Windows automation
- C# for more robust applications
- Linux system tools and bash scripting

## Projects

Most of my projects focus on:
- Cloud gaming security research
- Console modding tools
- System automation
- FOSS development
